## User Data Collection

The application collects only the minimum amount of data required to identify a user within the system.

### Collected data
- User ID (generated by the system)
- Email address (used as a unique identifier)
- Consent to Terms of Service (true/false)

### Data minimization
No personal data such as real name, address, age, or location is collected.
The system follows the principle of collecting only what is necessary for the application to function.

## User Account Creation

Users can create an account through an API call.
No database is used at this stage; users are stored in memory for demonstration purposes.

### Create user

**POST** `/api/users`

**Request body (example):**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "acceptTerms": true
}

## Behavior

A user account is created only if the user has actively accepted the Terms of Service.

If acceptTerms is false, the account creation is rejected.

Each user is assigned a unique system-generated user ID.

## Data Privacy Policy

### What data we collect
The application collects only the minimum data required to function: an email address and a system-generated user ID. No real names, addresses, locations, or other personal details are collected.

### Why we collect this data
The email is used to uniquely identify a user account. The user ID is used internally by the system to associate data with a user.

### Data limitations
User data is stored only in memory for demonstration purposes. No database or long-term storage is used at this stage.

### Data security
As this is a prototype, advanced security measures are not implemented. However, access to user data is limited to the application logic.

### User rights
Users have the right to delete their account and all associated personal data at any time.

### Consent
User accounts can only be created if the user actively consents to the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy.
