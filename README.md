## User Data Collection

The application collects only the minimum amount of data required to identify a user within the system.

### Collected data
- User ID (generated by the system)
- Email address (used as a unique identifier)
- Consent to Terms of Service (true/false)

### Data minimization
No personal data such as real name, address, age, or location is collected.
The system follows the principle of collecting only what is necessary for the application to function.

## User Account Creation

Users can create an account through an API call.
No database is used at this stage; users are stored in memory for demonstration purposes.

### Create user

**POST** `/api/users`

**Request body (example):**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "acceptTerms": true
}
